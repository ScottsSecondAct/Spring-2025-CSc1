      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Grace Brewster Hopper (née Murray; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992)
        was an American computer scientist, mathematician, and United States
        Navy rear admiral.[1] She was a pioneer of computer programming. Hopper
        was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming
        languages, and used this theory to develop the FLOW-MATIC programming
        language and COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in
        use today. She was also one of the first programmers on the Harvard Mark
        I computer. She is credited with writing the first computer manual, "A
        Manual of Operation for the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator."

        Before joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in both mathematics and
        mathematical physics from Yale University and was a professor of
        mathematics at Vassar College. She left her position at Vassar to join
        the United States Navy Reserve during World War II. Hopper began her
        computing career in 1944 as a member of the Harvard Mark I team, led by
        Howard H. Aiken. In 1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer
        Corporation and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I
        computer. At Eckert–Mauchly she managed the development of one of the
        first COBOL compilers.

        She believed that programming should be simplified with an English-based
        computer programming language. Her compiler converted English terms into
        machine code understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper had finished her
        program linker (originally called a compiler), which was written for the
        A-0 System.[2][3][4][5] In 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead
        their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of
        some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. In 1959, she
        participated in the CODASYL consortium, helping to create a
        machine-independent programming language called COBOL, which was based
        on English words. Hopper promoted the use of the language throughout the
        60s.

        The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper
        was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer at
        NERSC,[6] and the Nvidia GPU architecture "Hopper".[7][8] During her
        lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities
        across the world. A college at Yale University was renamed in her honor.
        In 1991, she received the National Medal of Technology. On November 22,
        2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by
        President Barack Obama.[9] In 2024, the Institute of Electrical and
        Electronics Engineers (IEEE) dedicated a marker in honor of Grace Hopper
        at the University of Pennsylvania for her role in inventing the A-0
        compiler during her time as a Lecturer in the School of Engineering,
        citing her inspirational impact on young engineers.[10][11]
